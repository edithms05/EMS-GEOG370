    <h1>Homework 6.1: Census data choropleth</h1>
    <h2>Edie Sherlock</h2>
    <h3>I wanted to examine the enrollment rates for students living in Idaho per county. The data that I used shows a range from 192,000-1,000,000 students, which is shown by the legend on the map below.</h3>

    <h1>Homework 6.2: Census data ratios and categories</h1>
    <h2>Male vs. Female Student Population</h2>
    <h3>For this map, I compared the overall male and female student populations from kindergarden to graduate school in the state of Idaho, including those who are not enrolled in schoool. It uses the total student population, as shown on the map behind the pie charts. I created this ratio to show the how each gender compares when it comes to school enrollment in the state of Idaho. This map represents this data fairly well, however the pie charts are hard to fully scale because of the way that Idaho's population is spread across the state.</h3>
